&lt;p&gt;Misson statements. Hands up for anyone who loves their company
mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands up for anyone who &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; their company mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many organizations, the mission statement is laid out by top level
leadership, sometimes with input from departments or individuals. It tends
to be a general and somewhat fluffy set of words that could apply to
just about any organization. And that makes most mission statements
forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean your maintenance team should not have a mission
statement! Your job together with your team is to come up with a
statement that reflects how you want to be seen and heard within
the organization moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your department has undergone another re-organization because ... actually
it doesn't matter. The goal was to step-change
the innovation culture so that your company can quickly deliver world-class
experiences that delight your customers and exceed their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? Depressingly familiar? Wasn't this supposed to be one
of the outcomes of the last reorganization? What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, take heart. Leadership doesn't wake up one morning and decide
on how to make things worse. There is a genuine desire to
make things better - what's missing sometimes is asking the hard questions
that drive change in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at why innovation is so hard to achieve in some
business environments, and what we can do to turn things around. This
is definitely not a list of "5 Easy Ways To Innovate" - it's more
about taking stock of where your organization is today, and deciding on
the first steps towards where you want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've been working for hours to figure out why the system you have delivered
fails very occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have good bug reports that show it takes
about 25 days of continuous run time for the failure to occur, and it's
happened at 4 different sites now. You get a spidey sense that it might be
related to a timer and pull out your phone and fire up &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thomasokken.com/free42/"&gt;Free-42&lt;/a&gt; (because you
like RPN calculators). The math for a 1 msec timer interval says
that a 32 bit unsigned int should be good for about 50 days ... wait a
minute. The restarts happen about 25 days apart!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find the place where someone did a calculation with the clock using
signed instead of unsigned values, and mumble "I wish that we had a coding
standard to catch this".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said nobody. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you really needed was a Developer's Guide for this project, a test-driven
development mindset, and a review process that could work together with continuous
integration to have a better chance at catching the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the title is designed to catch your eye, and a coding standard is
not a bad thing. Just pick one that's already out there like the Linux Kernel
or MicroPython coding standard and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
