&lt;p&gt;From time to time, a developer asks me "How can I convince my
team/manager/organization to ..." - and after a brief discussion
with followup questions, I often answer "you can't convince them".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's let that sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why convincing someone that your awesome
idea is worth pusuing is harder that you might think. It often
has less to do with your idea, or your presentation, and more to do
with how the folks around you are motivated and measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's let that sink in too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few basic truths about why it's hard to implement change
that have almost nothing to do with the quality or substance of the
idea - so let's dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you haven't seen "2001: A Space Odyssey", you have probably heard
someone say "Open the pod bay door, HAL".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't do that, Dave" is a familiar feeling for embedded systems developers
when your hardware isn't doing what you think it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you might have guessed that this article is about how having a HAL
(Hardware Abstraction Layer) for your embedded system makes your life easy,
changing to a new CPU is fast and painless, and the kids all get ballons
and ice cream when your port takes only hours because of your awesome
platform approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is always different - what started as a simple port is now a
bit more complicated because a new RTOS is mandated, and there
are new security requirements, and the interface to expander boards is
different, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, the HAL is the least of your problems because on top
of the architectural changes, you don't have any kind of unit test framework
or continuous integration system to help you move forward with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take heart - this is the perfect time to get all of that stuff in place
with a small and focused team. And you can take advantage of the fact that
you don't have any hardware yet to get these critical building blocks in
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's find out how to approach this starting with the HAL ...&lt;/p&gt;
