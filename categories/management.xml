&lt;p&gt;Even if you haven't seen "2001: A Space Odyssey", you have probably heard
someone say "Open the pod bay door, HAL". It's usually part of a engineering
joke where HAL-9000 stubbornly refuses to open the door. "I can't do that, Dave"
is a familiar feeling for embedded systems developers when your hardware
isn't doing what you think it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you might have guessed that this article is about how having a HAL
(Hardware Abstraction Layer) for your embedded system makes your life easy,
and the kids all get ballons when your port takes only minutes because of
your awesome platform approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is always different - what started as a simple port is now a
bit more complicated because a different RTOS is now mandated, and there
are new security requirements, and the interface to expander boards is
different, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, the HAL is the least of your problems because on top
of the architectural changes, you don't have any kind of unit test framework
or continuous integration system to help you move forward with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take heart - this is the perfect time to get all of that stuff in place
with a small and focused team. And you can take advantage of the fact that
you don't have any hardware yet to get these critical building blocks in
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's find out how to approach this starting with the HAL ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your department has undergone another re-organization because ... actually
it doesn't matter. The goal was to step-change
the innovation culture so that your company can quickly deliver world-class
experiences that delight your customers and exceed their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? Depressingly familiar? Wasn't this supposed to be one
of the outcomes of the last reorganization? What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, take heart. Leadership doesn't wake up one morning and decide
on how to make things worse. There is a genuine desire to
make things better - what's missing sometimes is asking the hard questions
that drive change in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at why innovation is so hard to achieve in some
business environments, and what we can do to turn things around. This
is definitely not a list of "5 Easy Ways To Innovate" - it's more
about taking stock of where your organization is today, and deciding on
the first steps towards where you want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
