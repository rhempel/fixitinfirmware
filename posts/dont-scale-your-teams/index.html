<p>The team you have been a part of for the last 6 months has been amazing. No, they
haven't pulled a month of 60+ hour work weeks to get a new release out the
door.</p>
<p>It has just been a stream of steady progress towards a shared goal, true collaboration
instead of procedural coordination, willingness to change ways of working
in small steps, and a sense of getting really good at what they are doing.</p>
<p>The team is getting noticed, not for heroics, but for simply getting sh#t done.</p>
<p>And with that recognition comes the request to somehow capture the <em>process</em> that your
team is using, and then replicate or scale that to other teams. What could possibly
go wrong?</p>
<p>Just about everything - starting with the assumption that the high-functioning team is
somehow adhering to a checklist of process steps to efficiently deliver value, and by
extension good outcomes for the business. Similarly, high-functioning teams in an
organization that doesn't support collaboaration are doomed to an existence of
frustration.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to "process" your way out of trouble when doing complex work, but
you can definitely make your culture more friendly to complex work.</p>
<p>Let's dive a little deeper, and hopefully come away with an appreciation of how a
high-functioning team gets that way, and why scaling that team's ways of working
rarely has the intended impact across the organization.</p>

</ul></nav><section id="why-management-likes-processes"><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1" role="doc-backlink">Why Management Likes Processes</a></h2>
<p>First, let me clear the air and say that I like process for tasks that require it. As an
embedded systems developer, process helps me and my team release reliable firmware that
we believe works. Process helps us to ensure that the components in the embedded system
are suited to the task, and that together with our electrical and mechanical partners
in crime we build a product that can actually be manufactured.</p>
<p>Traditional <a class="reference external" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_(management)">Command and Control</a> management relies on process to reliably produce outputs
using repetitive tasks given uniform quality inputs. It works well as long as the workforce
is treated fairly and has a stake in the outcome. It works for building PCBAs, running
test equipment, and assembling your product.</p>
<p>If you are a manager trained in the traditional Taylorian ways, and you are looking
after a department that makes products that suit this way of working, great. You are
going to be just fine, and you are completely replaceable.</p>
<p>Process helps make predictable work ... predicatable.</p>
<p>My key insight after 40 years of building and delivering embedded systems is that it
is far from predictable. In fact, most of the time you will spend trying to make delivering
complex work predictable is waste. Wasted time, effort, and resources are your worst
enemy - in any business.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with scaling successful teams across your organization?</p>
<p>It is the realaization that your team success has very little to do with exactly which
process they are following to get things done - it has everything to do with how they
are able to inspect and adapt their ways of working to changing conditions while still
following the processes relevant to delivering on goals that are shared with other teams.</p>
</section><section id="process-can-make-brittle-productivity"><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2" role="doc-backlink">Process Can Make Brittle Productivity</a></h2>
<p>When I first heard the term "brittle productivity", it immediately clicked as a way of
understanding the difference between doing lots of things and actually getting things
done. I also realized that a checklist of process steps could become a negotiation
point - what can you shave off the checklist to get the thing done faster?</p>
<p>Once you start negotiating a checklist, you build a well-worn path to chaos
and mediocrity. Pilots never negotiate the checklist - they also don't put useless
items in the checklist. The trick is in ensuring that your checklist is there to help
your team get things done.</p>
<p>Checklists filled with steps that don't provide value are examples of brittle
productivity. Yes, the steps are getting done, but how well? Do we have metrics for
those steps? Wait, we need to add some more steps to ensure that THIS step is
performed correctly, and we need a report, or a meeting for people to sign
off on the checklist ... it's exhausting.</p>
<p>What happens when the signoff meeting only happens every two weeks - the step is
delayed. What happens when the step is skipped due to schedule pressure - the risk
of delivering poor quality increases. What happens when someone identifies a way to
change the process and eliminate the step - the process change management process
kicks in and nothing changes because of the effort required to change a process.</p>
<p>This is brittle productivity - a team is doing a lot of things, but it seems like
nothing is getting done.</p>
<p>Wait, what about your team? Why is it doing so much better than the others? How
can we translate what your team is doing and bring it to the other teams?</p>
</section><section id="the-team-controls-some-of-the-process"><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3" role="doc-backlink">The Team Controls Some Of The Process</a></h2>
<p>Don't be tempted to talk about starting a transformation journey to empower teams
to be more agile and drive decision making further down the chain unless you are
prepared for pushback on process or business tactics. Why are we building this
thing when the other thing is what's keeping our business running? Are you sure
customers want this redesign? Why do we make an annual project plan and then
blow it up 3 months later?</p>
<p>This is where I tend to lose many leaders. Having a team control the process of
how they deliver value to the business sounds like a recipe for disaster. One
way to avoid trouble is to be clear about what is non-negotiable, and what is
in the control of the team.</p>
<p>This can be done in a meeting where Diana Larsen's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dianalarsen.com/blog/2010/07/26/circles-and-soup/">Soup Exercise</a> plays
a key role in clearly defining what the team has control over.</p>
<p>Maybe an example would help. Let's take a common step in delivering a piece of
software - the code review. Love them or hate them, they are on almost every
software delivery checklist, and for good reason. Unless the reason is catching
bugs.</p>
<p>I used to really dislike code reviews because they were often tacked on very late
in the development cycle, sometimes even after testing. They were huge, bloated, and
unfocused in scope. They included all kinds of non-functional changes such as
reformatting whitespace, comment alignments, and even re-ordering functions to
avoid having to add prototypes. They took forever to complete because nobody had
the time to do them properly, and they were often just exercises in pointing out
things to change the next time we had to touch the code.</p>
<p>Code reviews were required, but how they were executed made them almost
useless. The code review was non-negotiable - the culture around code
review was up to the team.</p>
<p>We had a meeting where we agreed that code reviews were required, but we
also had a deep dive into the role of the review - and it turned out that the real
purpose was as a training tool. This is how we think about making changes to the
code. This is how we make sure the code is testable. This is why we break the coupling
with that module. And on it goes.</p>
<p>But to do that, we had to take control of the code review process - and that meant
establishing a lightweight approach that could adapt as needed. Here is what we
started with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>No whitespace changes. Those belong in a different set of commits, and don't need
review. Better yet, use a tool like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify">uncrustify</a> and git pre-commit hooks and
never argue about code formatting again.</p></li>
<li><p>Small, focused commits. Your merge request has 26 files and 8 unrelated changes? Nope.
Break your change set into 8 commits and learn to use <code class="docutils literal">git add <span class="pre">-p</span></code>. A code review
takes time and mental effort to be useful, so respect your reviewer and make your
review request as easy as possible to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't put more than one or two people on the review list. Code review is a learning
experience for you and other developers. So add a reviewer that is likely to benefit
from seeing your changes, and a developer that can give constructive feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>All tests are passing. Your tests are just there to ensure code coverage? Nope. Make
those tests mean something. They should link back to an actual requirement, use case,
error condition, etc. There is an exception for code that is truly a proof-of-concept
and you're looking for feedback on the approach. In that case you want to have a
discussion about how this approach affects testability.</p></li>
<li><p>The code review tool doesn't integrate well with your git provider? Stop using that
tool and use whatever your git system has that is already built-in.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One more thing - we gave any developer the authority and autonomy to refuse a code
review as long as they could point to one of the basic process steps that would make
the review a waste of time.</p>
<p>Within a couple of cycles we had code reviews that were useful and completed quickly.
The team understood the value of more frequent reviews
and started to collaborate earlier in the development process. By building a learning
culture around code review, we also supported developers reaching out to each other
to discuss different approaches. This resulted in less rework, and enabled more junior
developers to improve their design and presentation skills when asking seniors for
input.</p>
</section><section id="scaling-complex-work-process"><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4" role="doc-backlink">Scaling Complex Work != Process</a></h2>
<p>Let's circle back to the main point of this post, which is why you shouldn't try
to scale your teams. Of course, you should try to use common tools where it makes
sense, and to share best practices across teams. Be wary of trying to standardize
process or tools across all teams in an organization. Every project really is
different, each team will have unique dynamics, and unique unexpected challenges will
be revealed randomly.</p>
<p>It makes no sense to expect that uniform ways of working will ensure the same level
of quality or pace when there is so much complexity in the work itself. If your
teams span multipler cultures then you have yet another variable to take into
account.</p>
<p>And no, after fixing the obvious process issues, you can't just think harder or
engineer better to improve predictability.</p>
<p>One more challenge with scaling across the organization - it often leads to the creation
of a separate function that is responsible for developing, delivering, and maintaining a complex
process. By definition, this will now be a bottleneck for continuous improvement in
your development process.</p>
<p>The new engineering process team will say that the process is a "living document" and will
be continuously updated to reflect "industry best practices" so that we can "improve
delivery efficiency and reliabilty". Unfortunately I have never seen such a department
be flexible or update the process unless there is yet another massive project to
simplify the development process and standardize work across teams.</p>
<p>The cycle is never ending.</p>
</section><section id="tl-dr"><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5" role="doc-backlink">TL;DR</a></h2>
<p>Long story short, you want to scale the adoption of a learning culture, not the tools
or rules for the steps in your process. A learning culture lets teams build their own
ways of working, and multiple collaborative teams will naturally enforce basic
standards of work when shared across teams.</p>
<p>One very important caveat though! Leadership MUST support the learning culture and
take decisive action when a team is obviously not delivering valuable outcomes to
their dependent teams. How that should be done depends on the situation, but it's
often removing toxic leaders or team members, and sometimes finding a suitable role
for an individual that is not fitting in. That's a post for another time.</p>
<p>One final thought, if you have one or more teams that are doing really well when the
rest of the organization is struggling, please take the opportunity to ask yourself
what the organizational impediments might be - not what the struggling teams are
doing wrong.</p>
