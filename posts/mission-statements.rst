Misson statements. Hands up for anyone who loves their company
mission statement.

Hands up for anyone who *knows* their company mission statement.

In many organizations, the mission statement is laid out by top level
leadership, sometimes with input from departments or individuals. It tends
to be a general and somewhat fluffy set of words that could apply to
just about any organization. And that makes most mission statements
forgettable.

But that doesn't mean your maintenance team should not have a mission
statement! Your job together with your team is to come up with a
statement that reflects how you want to be seen and heard within
the organization moving forward.

One step towards improving your team's visibility is to have a 30-60 minute
workshop to identify your key responsibilities and accountabilities. Don't
work on your misison statement yet - just keep that list up on a
whiteboard and make sure that it accurately reflects the team's
purpose. As you do your work, feel free to update the whiteboard by
adding, consolidating, or removing items. Within 1-2 weeks the lists will
be boiled down to a few items that will represent your team's "reason
for being" - that's the core of your mission.

Maintenance engineering can be extremely demanding because
your work impacts not only future production but also every unit that
has ever been produced and sold. You could be working on tasks
as varied as reducing manufacturing cost, adding a new feature, or
making a fix that can be applied in the field. In rare cases your team
will have to make a call to stop production or even recall a product.

How do those high level tasks fit into your company's mission statement?
They probably don't - and that's why you and the team need to have one
that feels authentic and relevant for you, while still supporting the
overall company mission.

Mission statements that are authentic are very hard to come by, so why
not take inspiration from an existing statement and modify it (if needed)
to be relevant for your team?

Two of my personal favorites are:

    - "Tough and competent"
    - "Failure is not an option"

    -- Gene Kranz (Apollo Flight Director)

Almost every engineer has at one time or another watched Apollo 13 and
has reflected on their personal work. If you haven't watched it recently,
please make some time to do so, or look up any documentary on the
Apollo program. Maybe bring it up in your next team meeting and ask
for input on an engineering heavy documentary that you can all watch.

Then spend 30 minutes or so on a team reflection to gather input on
what is the most relevant thing the team can do in the next 2-4 weeks
that makes them feel proud of what they are doing.

... but we DID fail - now what?
-------------------------------

I just said that *Failure is not an option* is one of my guiding star
statements. At LEGO we have a similar one - *Only the best is good enough*.

As much as I admire these statements, they come with a downside. They
may set up the organization to believe that failures will not happen, or
support a culture of not releasing a product until it's perfect and
complete.

Of course these are relevant statements for space flight, where cost and
quality are in step with each other. In consumer and commercial goods,
you *will* have failures in design, production, software, and process - and
they will almost always be coupled with schedule and cost pressure or
incorrect assumptions.

Your job as part of the maintenance team is to be prepared to address
these failures, and to do so professionally. That means making sure that:

  #. You value facts over guessing
  #. You fix the root cause and not the symptom
  #. You communicate clearly in a timely fashion

This is where *Tough and Competent* comes in. You and the team need to
be competent in gathering facts and getting to root cause. Then you
need to be tough in challenging assumptions and reporting your findings
and recommendations.

What you and your team discover, how you solve the problem, and the
way you communicate it up the chain will have a huge impact on your team's
visibility and credibility. Never waste the opportunity.

Managing engineering failures that get escalated to senior leadership
is a real challenge, and I'll review personal stories of failure and
success in future posts.
