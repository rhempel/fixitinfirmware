Guess what - you've been asked to get involved with a project team that needs
a bit of help. They have been working for many years as part of the global
development organization, and have taken over the maintenance of the firmware
for the microcontrollers that support the hardware around the core
of a Linux based product. It could be automotive, industrial, consumer, or
anything else - the details don't matter.

In the past decade the business has come to rely on this team for bug
fixes, new features, and even end-of-life core component replacements. When
development of a new generation of the product was announced, this team was
naturally part of the plan to deliver the support micro firmware because
it was going to be "just" a port of the existing firmware to a new micro
with a few updates to the HAL and operating system and maybe some other
platform level drivers.

Oh, and the team is located remotely and has a line management strucure
that is different that the product design and engineering structure.

.. FILL IN A FEW MORE DETAILS HERE.

If you have had any experience with projects that need a bit of help, you
probably recognize this situation. It's a team that has good people on it
but is missing a few key items that will help them to succeed. And it's not
just the team, the project and the organization might have some things that
need help as well.

What can we do to help this team succeed without taking away their
autonomy and at the same time building up their skills and capabilities so that
they come out of this project in great shape?

Let's find out.

.. TEASER_END

We Do These Things Not Because They Are Easy ...
------------------------------------------------

Many readers will recognize this phrase as the first part of John F. Kennedy's
famous speech that kicked off the Apollo project. Of course it ends with
" ... but because they are hard". That is a wonderful philosophy, it's at the
same aspirational level as Sir Edmund Hillary saying he climbed Mount Everest "because it was
there". Any complex project is going to be difficult to pull off successfully
and it's a good idea to acknowledge that up front.

Recently, engineers have been posting pictures of another version:

We do these things not because they are easy, but because we *thought* they would be easy"

That's funny and sad at the same time because it rings so true for many of us. If
we take it to heart, we can use it as an opening statatement in a retrospective.
It acknowledges that we find ourselves in a situation that is much different than
what we originally thought it was going to be. It's time to find out if we can
get to a good outcome by just putting our heads down and working hard, or if we need
to something a little different.


Aligning With Your Sponsor Group
--------------------------------

Before you even get started, it's important to get alignment with your sponsor group
on exactly what your role is. Are you there to:

- Be an extra set of hands on a keyboard
- Review requirements and tell the team what to do
- Help them update processes and ways of working
- Provide technical guidance
- Coach the team to help them learn different approaches

Hopefully it's a little of everything, but it's important that you have a clear
direction from the project leaders that have brought you in, and that you
understand your scope of influence. This is the time to establish the level of
trust and commitment that both sides need if you and your new team are able
to succeed.

One tool I have found to be useful (thanks to Bent Mylerrup of Better Change Consultants)
is the Coaching Contract.

 
The Retrospective Prime Directive
---------------------------------

One of the first things we should do is take stock of where we are. The project
is late, schedules and budgets are being questioned, and the knives are being
sharpened. Now is not the time to jump in and start making big changes. That's
not to say that changes don't need to be made - it's just that people
under a lot of stress don't respond well to even more changes in their daily
situation.

I like to start a project reboot with a retrospective, but before
we go ahead and plan a morning workshop with stakeholders, let's gather some
information. 

Always keep the Retrospective Prime Directive in mind when you work
with any group on a project. It states that "People have made their
choices using the best possible information at the time - and we need
to respect those choices now. We suggest improvements or alternatives
as possibilities, not as the "right way to do things".

I often start with the project or program manager - they are generally
in a position to describe the current state of the project and may have
some comments and thoughts about how they have arrived there. Ask about
the project history, any goals that were stated at the kickoff, and maybe
what successes or setbacks they have encoutered so far.

If the project really does need help, this is the person that is most
likely facing serious questions from leadership - and they may also
be frustrated with other parts of the organization. Find out what their
top one or two impediments are and reflect on them. It might be a lack
of transparency from the developers, or continuous scope chnages from
product management, or lack of support from leadership on any number
of topics.

Do not skip this step! It's where you have a chance to anticipate
what's going to happen in a retrospective, what the team will bring
out during the workshop, and what you will need to be able to influence
or control for the next few months. Always show respect and empathy for
the current situation - it's your job to help the team to succeed, not
to wonder out loud how they got into this situation.

Planning the First Workshop - Individual Motivation
---------------------------------------------------

One of the most powerful ways to understand the dynamics of the team
you will be helping is to help them to discover their individual
motivations. This must be done an a thoughtful way, you can't just
schedule a 1:1 with each of them and ask what motivates them.

Just as it was important to get alignment with your leadership team
on your role and scope of influence, it is vital that your leaders
communicate your role to the project team. When I worked in Denmark
we used the phrase "get the team dressed-up for the next assignment".

You will then have a conversation with the team leadership to align
on what you will be doing during the next few weeks, and it's a good
idea to have a rough plan or timeline so they can help you make things
happen without disrupting ongoing development.

The general outline is something like this:

- Map out the currect state of the project, including references to
   the original project plan together with the project manager
- Gather feedback from individual contributors by asking questions
   on how they see the current state.
- Ask powerful questions to get a sense of what motivates team
   members. What makes them want to get up and come to work, and
   what is demotivating for them.
   
I can't provide a detailed process for synthesising the results
of these interviews - there are many authors that have much more 
extensive writings than I am able to put into a blog post. The
main thing to remember is to use active listening, take notes, and
ask clarifying questions when you are unsure of what the other
person means.

This is your opportunity to gain trust, and to ask for a single, small,
and actionable improvement that this person can take ownership of

and mix in some powerful questions










One way to think about innovation is the combination of two or
more well known ideas into something new. Notice that I used
ideas - not technologies, or applications, or processes, or even
customer requests. An idea can be any of these things and more.

Innovation is hybrid of research and development. It's a
place where you need to be able to test if two or more ideas can
be combined (research) and then convert that into a product or a
component that can be used in a product (development). More on
this distinction in another article.

Before a company can improve its innovation capabilities, it's a good
idea to understand how innovative it is right now. Here's a little
table that can be used as inspiration:

.. topic:: Risk

    How are we managing risk - is there a process to mature new
    ideas or are we hoping for success by doing research while we
    are developing the product?

.. topic:: Focus

    Are we assuming innovation is something everyone is supposed to do
    or is there a more formal innovation process or team?
    
.. topic:: Profile
  
    Are we rotating people into innovation projects based only on their
    skills or are we also ensuring they have an innovation mindset?

One of the biggest sources of failure for companies that want to be
innovative is to ignore the difference between research and development.
Innovation is not about taking risks and hoping for a good outcome - it's
about evaluating and being realistic about risks and rewards as you learn
more about your product and its market.

Putting a focused team on innovation might seem like a bad idea - after all
who doesn't want to be innovative? If innovation is one of your KPIs or OKRs
across multiple functions, it can set your teams up for intense competition
for budget, people, and recognition. That's why it's a good idea to rotate
people into an innovation team beased on their profile and also their interest in
the problem being researched.  

I often hear leaders talk about the Apollo program (they usually mean all
the programs leading up to putting a human on the moon). You will often
hear about "moonshot" programs, or "reach for the stars and you will get to
the moon". The Apollo program was not built on hopes and dreams. It was
accomplished with the help of great leadership, separating financial from
technical decisions, building risky components in parallel using different
technologies to minimize dependencies, and instilling a sense of a common
goal with joint responsibility for the very clear outcome of the program.

The Apollo program was an extremely expensive way to get things done and
is a perfect example of the iron triangle of project management. Delivering
a high quality product in a very short time will cost a lot of money. The
program also had its share of failure and disappointment along the way, but
it also had at its core a shared vision and motivated, dedicated staff.

Innovation Is Steady Progress

Innovation can be risky, it's just common business sense to not put all
your eggs in one basket. This story might make the point clear.

Let's say your business is consumer goods, specifically cooking appliances
like residential stoves. For years families cooked on two main types of
heat - gas or electric. Gas burners have not changed much over the years. They
are hard to keep clean and waste a lot of energy by allowing the heat of
the flame to escape around the side of the pot. Chefs love gas because they
can quickly change the heat reaching the food by adjusting the flame.

Electric burners have not changed very much either. They are electric coils that
basically heat up your pot from underneath. The knobs on the stove
regulate the temperature by turning the supply of electricity fully on and off
as needed to maintain a temperature. The coils are easy to remove and replace
but hard to clean and require an opening in the stove top which can make spills
really messy.

For a while solid electric elements were popular because they looked easy to clean
but they had so much thermal mass that it was almost impossible to control the
heat quickly - plus they looked ugly and stayed hot for a long time.

Then came `Schott Ceran`_ - a miracle material that allows extreme heat under
the glass, and magically keeps most of the heat from spreading to the entire
surface. It's also very strong and durable and is easy to clean.

So far, so good. The other half of this story is `induction heating`_ which has
been around since Michael Faraday's time. The first patents for induction cooking
were issued around 1909, and Frigidaire had a practical demonstration stove
as early as the 1950's. Westinghouse produced the "Cool Top 2" induction stove
for about 2 years in the 1970's, and it cost about USD 8,260 in 2017 dollars!

The idea of `induction cooking`_ has a number of really big advantages including
a one-piece spill-proof top, easy cleanup if something does spill or boil over,
amazingly low heat transfer through the glass material, and high energy
efficiency. The disavantage is that it really only works well with steel,
iron, and some types of stainless steel pots.

What does this have to do with innovation? Both technologies had been
around for a long time but induction remained a very expensive option
that only a few could afford. As late as 2012 less than 5% of homes in
the US had an induction cooktop, but the number is changing rapidly - the
acceptance has hit an inflection point.

The innovation was a combination of detailed market analysis, relentless
cost reduction, experimenting with manufacturing processes, and modern touch
sensitive controls that further reduced the visual complexity of the cooktop.
It used very powerful word-of-mouth endorsements as fuel for the marketing
engine, and appealed to families that were trying to take advantage of
a more streamlined look in their new or renovated kitchen.

Here's the point of the story - no appliance manufacturer decided to be super
"innovative" and bet the farm on induction cook tops. That's gambling. Instead
a few industry leaders that had effective research and development areas 
built a limited number of units for sale knowing that they had to educate
users and appliance service people, knowing that they would most likely accept
lower (hopefully not negative) net revenue, and knowing that going all in
and putting too many early production cooktops in homes could lead to a
PR nightmare.

Conclusion
----------

Innovation in a company that has a well-understood business model and product
assortment respects that existing sales fund the research and development
needed to drive innovation. These companies continue to innovate
on the existing products in terms of features, cost reduction of components,
improving reliability, and simplifying the production and serviceability of
their products. They continue to market innovations on existing products by
doing experiments on financing, service agreements, providing incentive
programs to their sales channels, and so on.

Remember the Westinghouse Cool Top 2? It was only produced for 2 years in the 70's.
It was expensive and ahead of its time. Westinghouse continued to sell their 
conventional appliances because they knew that they could not bet the business
on an appliance that only a few people could ever afford.

But eventually market conditions changed, some of the electronic components
became more cost effective, and eventually there were enough induction cooktops
in the maret to hit a point where they were not unusual or exclusive.

Long story short, don't ignore your core business when striving to be
innovative. Respect your existing product line and remember that innovation
comes after your research department has matured an idea to the point 
where your development teams can muture the idea into a new or existing
product.
