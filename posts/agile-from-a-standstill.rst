Guess what - you've been asked to get involved with a project team that needs
a bit of help. They have been working for many years as part of the global
development organization, and have taken over the maintenance of the firmware
for the microcontrollers that support the hardware around the core
of a Linux based product. It could be automotive, industrial, consumer, or
anything else - the details don't matter.

In the past decade the business has come to rely on this team for bug
fixes, new features, and even end-of-life core component replacements. When
development of a new generation of the product was announced, this team was
naturally part of the plan to deliver the support micro firmware because
it was going to be "just" a port of the existing firmware to a new micro
with a few updates to the HAL and operating system and maybe some other
platform level drivers.

Oh, and the team is located remotely and has a line management strucure
that is different that the product design and engineering structure.

.. FILL IN A FEW MORE DETAILS HERE.

If you have had any experience with projects that need a bit of help, you
probably recognize this situation. It's a team that has good people on it
but is missing a few key items that will help them to succeed. And it's not
just the team, the project and the organization might have some things that
need help as well.

What can we do to help this team succeed without taking away their
autonomy and at the same time building up their skills and capabilities so that
they come out of this project in great shape?

Let's find out.

We Do These Things Not Because They Are Easy ...
------------------------------------------------

Many readers will recognize this phrase as the first part of John F. Kennedy's
famous speech that kicked off the Apollo project. Of course it ends with
" ... but because they are hard". That is a wonderful philosophy, it's at the
same aspirational level as Sir Edmund Hillary saying he climbed Mount Everest "because it was
there". Any complex project is going to be difficult to pull off successfully
and it's a good idea to acknowledge that up front.

Recently, engineers have been posting pictures of another version:

We do these things not because they are easy, but because we *thought* they would be easy ...

That's funny and sad at the same time because it rings so true for many of us. If
we take it to heart, we can use it as an opening statatement in a retrospective.
It acknowledges that we find ourselves in a situation that is much different than
what we originally thought it was going to be. It's time to find out if we can
get to a good outcome by just putting our heads down and working hard, or if we need
to something a little different.

Aligning With Your Sponsor Group
--------------------------------

Before you even get started, it's important to get alignment with your sponsor group
on exactly what your role is. Are you there to:

- Be an extra set of hands on a keyboard
- Review requirements and tell the team what to do
- Help them update processes and ways of working
- Provide technical guidance
- Coach the team to help them learn different approaches

Hopefully it's a little of everything, but it's important that you have a clear
direction from the project leaders that have brought you in, and that you
understand your scope of influence. This is the time to establish the level of
trust and commitment that both sides need if you and your new team are able
to succeed.

One tool I have found to be useful (thanks to Bent Mylerrup of Better Change Consultants)
is the Coaching Contract.

 
The Retrospective Prime Directive
---------------------------------

One of the first things we should do is take stock of where we are. The project
is late, schedules and budgets are being questioned, and the knives are being
sharpened. Now is not the time to jump in and start making big changes. That's
not to say that changes don't need to be made - it's just that people
under a lot of stress don't respond well to even more changes in their daily
situation.

I like to start a project reboot with a retrospective, but before
we go ahead and plan a morning workshop with stakeholders, let's gather some
information. 

Always keep the Retrospective Prime Directive in mind when you work
with any group on a project. It states that "People have made their
choices using the best possible information at the time - and we need
to respect those choices now. We suggest improvements or alternatives
as possibilities, not as the "right way to do things".

I often start with the project or program manager - they are generally
in a position to describe the current state of the project and may have
some comments and thoughts about how they have arrived there. Ask about
the project history, any goals that were stated at the kickoff, and maybe
what successes or setbacks they have encoutered so far.

If the project really does need help, this is the person that is most
likely facing serious questions from leadership - and they may also
be frustrated with other parts of the organization. Find out what their
top one or two impediments are and reflect on them. It might be a lack
of transparency from the developers, or continuous scope chnages from
product management, or lack of support from leadership on any number
of topics.

Do not skip this step! It's where you have a chance to anticipate
what's going to happen in a retrospective, what the team will bring
out during the workshop, and what you will need to be able to influence
or control for the next few months. Always show respect and empathy for
the current situation - it's your job to help the team to succeed, not
to wonder out loud how they got into this situation.

Planning the First Workshop - Individual Motivation
---------------------------------------------------

One of the most powerful ways to understand the dynamics of the team
you will be helping is to help them to discover their individual
motivations. This must be done in a thoughtful way - you can't just
schedule a 1:1 with each of them and ask what motivates them.

Just as it was important to get alignment with your leadership team
on your role and scope of influence, it is vital that your leaders
communicate your role to the project team. When I worked in Denmark
we used the phrase "get the team dressed-up for the next assignment".

You will then have a conversation with the team leadership to align
on what you will be doing during the next few weeks, and it's a good
idea to have a rough plan or timeline so they can help you make things
happen without disrupting ongoing development.

The general outline is something like this:

- Map out the current state of the project, including references to
   the original project plan together with the project manager
- Gather feedback from individual contributors by asking questions
   on how they see the current state.
- Ask powerful questions to get a sense of what motivates team
   members. What makes them want to get up and come to work, and
   what is demotivating for them.
   
I can't provide a detailed process for synthesising the results
of these interviews - there are many authors that have much more 
extensive writings than I am able to put into a blog post. The
main thing to remember is to use active listening, take notes, and
ask clarifying questions when you are unsure of what the other
person means.

This is your opportunity to gain trust, and to ask for a single, small,
and actionable improvement that this person can take ownership of
