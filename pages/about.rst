This site is all about improving your skills and value as
an embedded systems developer or leader. I have been working in
this field for over 35 years now, and have learned a lot
by listening and watching all kinds of programmers in different
organizations. I have made my share of mistakes along the
way, some of them more than once.

I'm starting to forget some of the lessons learned so it's as
good a time as any to start writing down my thoughts, pass
along advice, and link to some really fantastic content that
other developers have been generous enough to make available 
on the Web.

We will cover a wide range of topics from soft skills to
bare-knuckle debugging and root cause analysis. I'll try to
mix it up with some opinion pieces and links to other blogs
that have inspired me to be better at what I do.

If you like (or don't like) what you see here, or have a topic
that you'd like me to write about, feel free to contact me.
