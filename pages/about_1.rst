About This Site
---------------

We'll have to fix it in firmware - how often have you heard that phrase?

This site is all about maintaining embedded systems firmware. From
helpful tools and techniques to insights on how to communicate with
your team and your leaders, I hope you can find some inspiration that
helps you become a better embedded systems programmer.

I'm Ralph Hempel, and I have been working in the embedded systems field
for almost 40 years now. This means smaller MCUs with up to 2 MB of FLASH
and 512K of RAM - but more often much less than that. My career has
spanned from the the early 4-bit NEC micros all the way to modern ARM
Cortex M0/1/3/4/7 devices.

I have written lots of code, mostly decent but sometimes terrible. I have
debugged and improved lots of code and have learned many lessons along
the way. You can find my public code on GitHub.

Please feel free to drop me a line if there is a topic you would
like to see covered, or if you have feedback for anything you
see here. I welcome the chance to learn something new :-)
