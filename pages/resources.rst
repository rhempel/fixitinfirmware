`Two's Complement <https://twoscomplement.org/>`

  A fun and often silly podcast where two guys discuss whatever comes to
  mind. `Matt Godbolt <https://xania.org/MattGodbolt>`_ and
  `Ben Rady <https://www.benrady.com/>`_ are well respected in the
  programming world and they have a very broad range of experience
  that they apply to their conversations. It's never boring!

`Embedded.fm <https://embedded.fm/>`_

  `Elecia White <https://mastodon.online/@logicalelegance>`_ and
  `Chris White <https://stoney.monster/@stoneymonster>`_ have over

  show interesting by including many voices that you might not
  expect to have a relationship with embedded systems.
