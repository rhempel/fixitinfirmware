&lt;p&gt;Even if you haven't seen "2001: A Space Odyssey", you have probably heard
someone say "Open the pod bay door, HAL". It's usually part of a engineering
joke where HAL-9000 stubbornly refuses to open the door. "I can't do that, Dave"
is a familiar feeling for embedded systems developers when your hardware
isn't doing what you think it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you might have guessed that this article is about how having a HAL
(Hardware Abstraction Layer) for your embedded system makes your life easy,
and the kids all get ballons when your port takes only minutes because of
your awesome platform approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is always different - what started as a simple port is now a
bit more complicated because a different RTOS is now mandated, and there
are new security requirements, and the interface to expander boards is
different, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, the HAL is the least of your problems because on top
of the architectural changes, you don't have any kind of unit test framework
or continuous integration system to help you move forward with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take heart - this is the perfect time to get all of that stuff in place
with a small and focused team. And you can take advantage of the fact that
you don't have any hardware yet to get these critical building blocks in
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's find out how to approach this starting with the HAL ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misson statements. Hands up for anyone who loves their company
mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands up for anyone who &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; their company mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many organizations, the mission statement is laid out by top level
leadership, sometimes with input from departments or individuals. It tends
to be a general and somewhat fluffy set of words that could apply to
just about any organization. And that makes most mission statements
forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean your maintenance team should not have a mission
statement! Your job together with your team is to come up with a
statement that reflects how you want to be seen and heard within
the organization moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your department has undergone another re-organization because ... actually
it doesn't matter. The goal was to step-change
the innovation culture so that your company can quickly deliver world-class
experiences that delight your customers and exceed their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? Depressingly familiar? Wasn't this supposed to be one
of the outcomes of the last reorganization? What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, take heart. Leadership doesn't wake up one morning and decide
on how to make things worse. There is a genuine desire to
make things better - what's missing sometimes is asking the hard questions
that drive change in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at why innovation is so hard to achieve in some
business environments, and what we can do to turn things around. This
is definitely not a list of "5 Easy Ways To Innovate" - it's more
about taking stock of where your organization is today, and deciding on
the first steps towards where you want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've been working for hours to figure out why the system you have delivered
fails very occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have good bug reports that show it takes
about 25 days of continuous run time for the failure to occur, and it's
happened at 4 different sites now. You get a spidey sense that it might be
related to a timer and pull out your phone and fire up &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thomasokken.com/free42/"&gt;Free-42&lt;/a&gt; (because you
like RPN calculators). The math for a 1 msec timer interval says
that a 32 bit unsigned int should be good for about 50 days ... wait a
minute. The restarts happen about 25 days apart!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find the place where someone did a calculation with the clock using
signed instead of unsigned values, and mumble "I wish that we had a coding
standard to catch this".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said nobody. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you really needed was a Developer's Guide for this project, a test-driven
development mindset, and a review process that could work together with continuous
integration to have a better chance at catching the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the title is designed to catch your eye, and a coding standard is
not a bad thing. Just pick one that's already out there like the Linux Kernel
or MicroPython coding standard and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
